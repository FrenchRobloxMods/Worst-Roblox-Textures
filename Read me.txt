Dont forget to extract the content.zip folder.

To setup the ROBLOX texture pack, copy the file named content that
is in the same folder of the Read me.txt file.

Go to Windows > Program Files x86 > Roblox > Versions > Your actual
ROBLOX version, then delete the existing content file and paste the 
new one.

Everything is finish. Enjoy the trolling.
